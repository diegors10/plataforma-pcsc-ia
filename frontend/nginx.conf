# The root is set to the default html directory where the Vite build
# copies its output.  The `try_files` directive ensures that any
# route not matching a physical file falls back to `index.html`.  This
# is crucial for single‑page applications that use client‑side
# routing.  Gzip compression is enabled to reduce payload size.
